Scenario: Successfully comparing two classes
  Given I am on the "Class" page
  And I select the class "ESS1" for comparison
  And I select the class "ESS2" for comparison
  When I confirm my selection
  Then I should see the class statistics for "ESS1"
  And I should see the class statistics for "ESS2"
  And I should remain on the "Class" page
